\section{Introduction}

Dynamic memory management is a crucial function of programming
languages.  Correct allocation and disposal of memory regions are
fundamental for software to be reliable.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The problem of correct dynamic memory management is challenging if a
programming language is equipped with manual memory management
primitives (e.g., \texttt{malloc} and \texttt{free} in the C
language.)  With such primitives, one can write a program that
accesses to deallocated memory regions (i.e., accesses to dangling
pointers) and that does not dispose memory region when it becomes
unnecessary (i.e., memory leak.)  In order to detect bugs related to
such primitives at the early stage of software development, many
static verification methods have been
proposed~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09,DBLP:conf/pldi/HeineL03,DBLP:conf/sigsoft/XieA05,DBLP:journals/scp/SwamyHMGJ06,DBLP:conf/sas/OrlovichR06,DBLP:conf/issta/SuiYX12}.

This paper proposes a type-based approach to static verification of
memory-leak freedom that works for nonterminating programs.  Although
memory leaks are relatively more serious in nonterminating programs
(e.g., operating systems and Web servers) than terminating ones, the
analyses proposed so far put less emphasis to nontermination; they
rather verify \emph{partial} memory-leak freedom: if a program
terminates, then all the allocated memory cells are deallocated.  We
say a program is \emph{totally} memory-leak free if it does not
consume unbounded amount of memory during execution.

Figure~\ref{ex:np} describes partial and total memory-leak freedom.
Both \(h\) and \(h'\) are partially memory-leak free because they do
not terminate.  The function \(h\) consumes at most two
cells\footnote{We assume that every memory cell allocated by
  \(\Malloc\) is fixed size.}; hence it is totally memory-leak free.
However, the function \(h'\), when it is invoked, consumes unbounded
number of memory cells; hence \(h'\) is not totally memory-leak free.

As a first step to the verification of total memory-leak freedom, this
paper proposes a \emph{behavioral type system}~\cite{} for a
programming language with manual memory-management primitives.  Our
type system captures an abstract behavior related to memory allocation
and deallocation as a CCS-like process.  For example, our type system
can assign a type \(
>>>>>>> 9de3b2e7efceb350a61d3588773d9007a53e6b5a
\mu\alpha.\Malloc\TSEQ\Malloc\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\alpha\) to the
function \(h\) above.  This type expresses that \(h\) can allocate a
memory cell twice, deallocate a memory cell twice, and then iterate
this behavior.  On the other hand, the type assigned to \(h'\) is
\(\mu\alpha.\Malloc\TSEQ\Malloc\TSEQ\alpha\TSEQ\Free\TSEQ\Free\),
which expresses that \(h'\) can allocate a memory cell twice, call
itself recursively, and then deallocate a memory cell twice.  Hence,
by inspecting the inferred types (by using off-the-shelf model
checkers, for example), one can estimate the upper bound required to
execute \(h\) and \(h'\). This way may be better than directly
modelchecking the original program, because we can ignore any other
statements except allocation and deallocation. We are now
investigating some practical programs to do experiments for this, and
experiments are not included in our paper.


Notice that our type system alone does not prevent incorrect usage of
\(\Malloc\) and \(\Free\).  Indeed, as observed from the type assigned
to \(h\) and \(h'\) above, our types include information only about
the number and the order of allocations, deallocations, and recursive
function calls; hence, the type system does not guarantee, for
example, there is no accesses to deallocated cells.  For such

properties, we expect a program to be verified by other

The rest of this paper is structured as
follows. Section~\ref{sec:language} introduces a simple imperative
language and the operational semantics of the
language. Section~\ref{sec:typesystem} introduces the behavioral type
system and proves the type soundness. Section~\ref{sec:reconstruction}
describes a type reconstruction algorithm.
Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork} discusses the related
work. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.

%% \subsection{Motivation and Problems}

%% Manual memory management primitives (e.g., \texttt{malloc} and
%% \texttt{free} in C) often cause that forgetting to deallocate memory
%% cells after use, which we call \emph{memory leaks}. It can diminish
%% the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available
%% memory cells. Memory leaks may not be serious or even detectable by
%% normal means. Normal memory used by an application is released when
%% application terminates. This means that a memory leak in a program
%% that only runs for a short time may not be noticed and is rarely
%% serious. However, in the real-world programs, nonterminating programs
%% such as Web servers and operating systems are very important. If
%% memory leaks in such nonterminating programs, eventually, too much of
%% the available memory cells may become allocated and all or part of the
%% system stops working correctly~\cite{wiki:xxx}.

%% Most of the static analysis of memory-leak freedom proposed so
%% far~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09,
%%   DBLP:conf/sas/OrlovichR06,DBLP:conf/pldi/HeineL03,DBLP:conf/sigsoft/XieA05,DBLP:journals/scp/SwamyHMGJ06}
%% deal with only \emph{partial memory-leak freedom}: if a program
%% terminates, allocated memory cells are all deallocated at the end. For
%% example, the type system by Suenaga and
%% Kobayashi~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/SuenagaK09}, which is called
%% \textbf{SK} type system in our paper, guarantees that (1) a well-typed
%% program does not conduct illegal accesses and that (2) after execution
%% of a well-typed program, all the memory cells are deallocated.

%% We tackle the problem of verifying \emph{total memory-leak freedom} in
%% this paper.\footnote{we often write memory-leak freedom for
%%   \emph{total} memory-leak freedom.} By a program being totally
%% memory-leak free, we mean that the program requires only a bounded
%% amount of memory even if it does not terminate.

%% \subsection{Approach}
%% %% <<<<<<< HEAD
%% %% =======
%% From examples in Figure~\ref{ex:np}, we notice that a simple way to guarantee memory-leak freedom for nonterminating programs is to check whether the number of allocations and deallocations is balanced before recursive call. If balanced, the program consumes bounded number of memory cells, say function $h$ allocates two memory cells and deallocates them before recursive call, it consumes two memory cells at most once; if not balanced, as function $h'$ shows, it allocates two memory cells but does not deallocate them before recursive call, which consumes unbounded number of memory cells as time goes by.

%% From examples in Figure~\ref{ex:np}, we notice that a possible way to
%% guarantee memory-leak freedom for nonterminating programs is to check
%% whether the number of allocations and deallocations is balanced before
%% recursive call. If balanced, the program consumes bounded number of
%% memory cells, say function $h$ allocates two memory cells and
%% deallocates them before recursive call, it consumes two memory cells
%% at most once; if not balanced, as function $h'$ shows, it allocates
%% two memory cells but does not deallocate them before recursive call,
%% which consumes unbounded number of memory cells as time goes by.

%% To estimate the upper bound of memory consumption, we count the number
%% of allocations and deallocations by a behavioral type system. The
%% behavioral type system is mainly used to abstract the behavior of a
%% program and heavily used in the context of concurrent program
%% verification~\cite{DBLP:journals/lmcs/KobayashiSW06,DBLP:journals/tcs/IgarashiK04,DBLP:conf/esop/HondaVK98}. The
%% behavior of a program in our paper is abstracted as CCS-like
%% processes~\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/MilnerPW92a}. For example, the
%% behavior of function $h$ is as $\mu
%% \alpha. \Malloc;\Malloc;\Free;\Free;\alpha$ which denotes it executes
%% $\Malloc$ twice, $\Free$ twice and calls itself. Similarly, the
%% behavior of $h'$ is abstracted as $\mu
%% \alpha. \Malloc;\Malloc;\alpha;\Free;\Free$.

%% One thing we should consider is like the function $f$ shown in Figure~\ref{ex:bbd}. The behavior of function $f$ is that $\Malloc$ twice, $\Free$ twice and calling itself. The abstracted behavior is $\mu \alpha. \Malloc;\Malloc;\Free;\Free;\alpha$. The number of allocation and deallocation is balanced before recursive call; the function is safe in our behavior type system, but it causes double frees: the variable $x$ is deallocated twice.
%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% 1  \Rtab\dtb\dtb $f(x)$= \\
%% 2  \dtb \dtb\dtb$\LET \; x = \MALLOC  \; \IN$ \\
%% 3  \dtb \dtb\dtb$\LET \; y = \MALLOC  \; \IN$ \\
%% 4  \dtb \dtb\dtb$\Free(y)$; $\Free(y) $;\;$f(x)$
%% \caption{balanced but double free}
%% \label{ex:bbd}
%% \end{figure}

%% Thanks to the \textbf{SK} type system, proposed by Suenaga and Kobayashi, it guarantees no double frees or illegal access to a deallocated memory cell. By combining the \textbf{SK} type system, our behavior type system can ignore the relationship between variables and pointers, so to estimate the upper bound of consumption memory cells according to the abstraction of the behavior of programs is sound.

%% \label{fig:ov}
%% \end{figure}

%% %% <<<<<<< HEAD
%% %% A program is first checked by $\mathbf{SK}$ type system; it is passed
%% %% to the behavioral type system proposed in our paper if its partial
%% %% correctness is guaranteed, otherwise returns ``it is not safe''; the
%% %% behavioral type system will check it and produce a behavioral type $P$
%% %% which abstracts the behavior of the program; and then by modeling the
%% %% behavioral type $P$ using model checkers like \texttt{SPIN} or
%% %% \texttt{CPAChecker} to verify whether the behavioral correctness of
%% %% the program is guaranteed. If its behavioral correctness is verified
%% %% by model checker, the safe memory deallocation for this program is
%% %% ensured, otherwise return ``it is not safe''.
%% %% =======
%% As represented in Figure~\ref{fig:ov}, a program is first checked by \textbf{SK} type system; if the properties about no double frees or illegal read/write operations to a deallocated memory cell is guaranteed, then it returns ``OK'' and the program is passed to our behavior type system, and it returns ``NG'' otherwise; our behavior type system will produce a behavioral type, and this behavioral type is passed to a model checker like \texttt{SPIN} or \texttt{CPAChecker} to verify whether it is consumed upper bound of memory cells.

%% Hence, by using our type system with \textbf{SK} type system, we can verify memory-leak freedom even for nonterminating programs.
