\section{Preliminary Experiments}
\label{sec:experiment}
In this section, we did the experiments by comparing applying a model
checker to original C language programs with to abstracted
behavior. Table~\ref{tb:mcc} and Table~\ref{tb:mca} show the results
of the experiments. All of the experiments are done on a machine with
an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 8MB cache and 3.76GB memory, running
on Debian (kernel version 2.6.32-5-amd64) and CPAchecker (version 1.3.4).

In these two tables, the meaning of each column is described as
follows. The column \texttt{original programs} and \texttt{abstracted behavior},
which mean applying the model checker to a original C language
program and to abstracted behavior respectively. These two columns
consist of several columns: $\sharp$\texttt{loc} means the number of
program locations; $\sharp$\texttt{fun} means the number of functions
in a program; \texttt{cpu time (total)} means the total execution time
of CPU in seconds; \texttt{memory(MB)} means the number of virtual
memory cells consumed by model checker in \texttt{MByte};
\texttt{fixed num} means the number of available memory cells which we
fix; the \texttt{true} or \texttt{false} behind \texttt{fixed num}
means it is \texttt{true} if the number of the memory cells which a
program consumes does not exceed the \texttt{fixed num}, otherwise it
is \texttt{false}.

The programs used for the experiments are described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{linklist.c} and \texttt{linklist2.c} initialize a list,
  and perform some operations on the list (insert , delete, locate a
  node and traverses the list), and destroy the list. The difference
  between \texttt{linklist.c} and \texttt{linklist2.c} is that the
  former creates list by the head-insertion, whereas the latter creates a list
  by the tail-insertion.
\item \texttt{linkstack.c} creates a stack, pushes some elements in
  the stack, traverses the stack and clear the stack.
\item \texttt{linkqueue.c} initializes a queue, inserts, deletes some
  elements in the queue, clears the queue and destroys the queue.
\item \texttt{binarysorttree.c} inserts some nodes in a binary tree
  and deletes all the allocated nodes.
\item \texttt{database.c} models a database. It opens a database and
  performs some operations on the database (retrieve, delete and
  update data, or create a new database) and closes the database.
\item \texttt{ihex2fw.c} is a file from Linux kernel
  \texttt{/firmware/ihex2fw.c}, which converts ihex files into binary
  representation for use by Linux kernel.
\item \texttt{gen\_init\_cpio.c} is a file from Linux kernel
  \texttt{/usr/gen\_init\_cpio.c}, which produces a binary file which
  performs on a file containing newline separated entries that
  describe the files to be included in the initramfs archive.
\end{itemize}

The results present in the these two tables show that the
resources required for model checking become smaller if applying model
checkers to the abstracted behavior, since the abstracted behavior
only consists of allocation and deallocation.

One thing we should notice in these tables is that for
each line, the result of \texttt{true} or \texttt{fals}e in
the\texttt{fixe num} column should be the same when model checking on
original programs and abstracted behavior, but it is not, for example,
\texttt{linklist.c} has the \texttt{true} under \texttt{original
  programs} column but the false under \texttt{abstracted behavior}
column. The reason is that our approach, abstracted behavior, can not
deal with conditional statements, function calls in another files,
loop statements, for example, the \texttt{linklist.c} consists of
statements like if-then-else and for-loop statements, which is
abstracted as $\Malloc;\mu\alpha.((\Malloc;\alpha) +
0));\mu\alpha.((\Free;\alpha) + 0)$. In fact, the \texttt{linklist.c}
does $\Malloc$ 6 times, and then $\Free$ 6 times, so it is safe; but
the abstracted behavior may perform like
$\Malloc;\mu\alpha.(\Malloc;\alpha));0$, this means consuming unbound
number of memory cells.
